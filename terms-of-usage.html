                <p>
                    If any provision of these terms is held to be unenforceable or
                    invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to
                    accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest
                    extent possible under applicable law and the remaining
                    provisions will continue in full force and effect.

                <p>
                    Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to
                    require performance of an obligation under these terms shall not
                    affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such
                    performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a
                    breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach
